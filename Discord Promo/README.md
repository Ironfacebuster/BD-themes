## Want your discord to look like the promotional images on [discord.com](https://discord.com/)?
You're in luck! I did too, so I made this theme!

I thought the colors that were used in the promotional images were pretty nice, and leagues above the default dark, so I made a theme!

`Note: BetterDiscord (or another modification that can load css files) is required!`

This theme features multiple addons that allow you to configure to your heart's content!

* Want slimmed down profile modals? **We got it!**
* You want your avatars to be slightly smaller, like the promos? **We got that too!**
* You want something not on the list? **We don't have it. (but we could in the future!)**
