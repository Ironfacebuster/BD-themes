## Want your discord to look like the promotional images on [discord.com](https://discord.com/)?
You're in luck! I did too, so I made this theme!

I thought the colors that were used in the promotional images were pretty nice, and leagues above the default dark.

`Note: BetterDiscord (or another modification that can load css files) is required!`

This theme features multiple addons that allow you to configure to your heart's content!

* Want slimmed down profile modals? **We got it!**
* You want your avatars to be slightly smaller, like the promos? **We got that too!**
* You want something not on the list? **We don't have it. (but we could in the future!)**

## How to install
1. Ensure Discord's theme is set to "Dark"
2. Download `discord-promo.theme.css` (the base theme) and put it in your themes folder
3. Enable the base theme, if needed.
4. Enjoy!

Don't like something? Try some of the addon files!
1. Download your desired addon, and put it alongside the base theme in your themes folder.
2. Enable both your base and addon themes.
3. Enjoy!
